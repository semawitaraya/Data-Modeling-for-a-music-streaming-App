<h2>Create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis<h2/>
  
  <p> A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.</p>

<p>As a data engineer, I've created a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. My role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis, test the database I created and ETL pipeline by running queries given to me by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare my results with their expected results.</p>
